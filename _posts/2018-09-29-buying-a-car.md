title: MDS Communications - Trump tweets during the 2016 campaign
---

My thoughts on the first lab assignment in MDS Communication and Argumentation.

For our first lecture in Communication & Argumentation, a class about communication in data science, we were asked to read and then write about [this blog post](http://varianceexplained.org/r/trump-tweets/) which discussed Trump tweets during the 2016 campaign.

I found this to be a particularly interesting for a number of reasons. I am American and I continue to follow US politics fairly closely. I regularly listen to the [NPR Politics Podcast](https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510310/npr-politics-podcast) as well as the [fivethirtyeight Politics Podcast](https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/). I abhor Trump. So, the subject matter of this blog post was a combination of two subjects I'm already passionate about -- US politics and data science. But aside from just combining interests, I appreciated the approach we took to thinking about the article, questioning it, and not just taking it at face value. Since I am already anti-Trump, this is the type of article I would normally just naturally agree with. It's valuable to take a step back and force myself to read skeptically, especially on a subject I have a tendency not to question when the argument matches my biases.

In a previous course I have done some sentiment analysis on tweets using R, so I was able to follow the article without getting too lost in the code details. I felt that the article conveyed a lot of strong evidence to back up the author's claim that Android-sourced tweets originated from Trump and iPhone tweets came from his campaign staff.
