I'm a Data Scientist at <a href="https://rocketinnovationstudio.ca/" target="_blank"> Rocket Innovation Studio</a>, an incubator for <a href="https://www.rocketmortgage.com/" target="_blank"> Rocket Mortgage</a> in Detroit. I work remotely and am based in Vancouver, BC. I am also an alumna of the University of British Columbia's <a href="https://masterdatascience.ubc.ca/" target="_blank"> Master of Data Science</a> program.

Before pivoting into data science, my experience was in the creative field of motion graphics. When I finished high school I received both art and math awards, which at the time seemed pretty odd, but now I feel like it describes me really well. With this non-traditional background, I bring a unique perspective and a wide breadth of business experience to the field of data science.

Iâ€™m passionate about politics, fitness, the environment, cooking, travel, and my two weird cats.
