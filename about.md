I recently completed a [Masters Degree in Data Science](https://masterdatascience.science.ubc.ca/) at the University of British Columbia. I'm seeking to combine my technical expertise and communication skills with my enthusiasm for math, statistics, and computer science. I'm a creative problem solver with 15 years of experience in the field of motion graphics and have a BFA in Computer Graphics. I'm passionate about politics, the environment, fitness, cooking, travel, and my two weird cats. I'm excited to merge my previous business experience with my new data science skillset.
