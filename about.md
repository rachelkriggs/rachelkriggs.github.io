I'm a Data Scientist at <a href="https://www.playbiba.com/" target="_blank"> Biba Ventures</a>, a startup that makes an app for families with the goal of encouraging kids to get more physical activity. I manage the data science team, analyze playground and game data, and build models to estimate playground attendance. I am also an alumna of the University of British Columbia's <a href="https://masterdatascience.ubc.ca/" target="_blank"> Master of Data Science</a> program.

I'm a Data Scientist at [Biba Ventures](https://www.playbiba.com/), a startup that makes an app for families with the goal of encouraging kids to get more physical activity. I manage the data science team, analyze playground and game data, and build models to estimate playground attendance. I am also an alumna of the University of British Columbia's [Master of Data Science](https://masterdatascience.ubc.ca/) program.

Before pivoting into data science, my experience was in the creative field of motion graphics. When I finished high school I received both the art award and the math award, which at the time seemed like an anomaly for one individual, but now feels justified. With this non-traditional background, I bring a unique perspective to the field of data science.

Iâ€™m passionate about politics, fitness, the environment, cooking, travel, and my two weird cats.
