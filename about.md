I recently completed a [Masters Degree in Data Science](https://masterdatascience.science.ubc.ca/) at the University of British Columbia. I'm seeking to combine my technical expertise and communication skills with my enthusiasm for math, statistics, and computer science. I'm a creative problem solver with 15 years of experience in the field of motion graphics.

I have a BFA in Computer Graphics from Pratt Institute and worked as a motion graphics animator, mainly in New York and for remote clients in the US and Canada. Usually when I tell people that I used to be an animator they assume I either drew cartoons or worked on 3D movies like 'Toy Story', but neither of those are really accurate. The work I did was mainly 2D and involved all sorts of different platforms, from film and tv titles, commercials, and music videos, to more obscure things like moving graphics as a backdrop in physical spaces like museums and hotels.

Over time I realized I have a more logical and technical brain and that a career change was to be the next chapter in my story. I returned to school, discovered the field of data science, and instantly fell in love. I'm passionate about politics, the environment, travel, cooking, and my two awesome cats. I'm excited to merge my previous business experience with my new data science skillset.
